Task0 - 
Time Complexity:
O(n)
since both record lists are traversed once.

Task1 - 
Time Complexity:
O(n)
Since the average time complexity of the set add method is O(1), 
and both lists are traversed.

Task2 - 
Time Complexity:
O(n)
Since the average time complexity of the dict add/get/set method is O(1), and the calls list is traversed.
The timeRecord dict is traversed through which is of O(m) time complexity, where m is the count
of phone numbers from the records, and m is less than n. So the average time complexity
in total is O(n).

Task3 - 
Time Complexity:
O(nlogn)
The calls list is traversed once which is of O(n).
The worst case, all call records are added to the call numbers set, and the call numebrs set is converted to a list.
The sort of the list has O(nlogn) time complexity. 

Task4 - 
Time Complexity:
O(n)
Since the average time complexity of the set add method is O(1), 
and both lists are traversed.
